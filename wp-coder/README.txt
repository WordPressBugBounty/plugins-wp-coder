== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Absolutely! WP Coder allows you to embed shortcodes from any plugin within your HTML snippet content. You can also use WP Coder’s own shortcodes, offering enhanced flexibility for customization.

Tags help categorize and organize your snippets. When creating or editing a snippet, assign tags in the 'Publish' block to easily filter and manage your snippets later.
